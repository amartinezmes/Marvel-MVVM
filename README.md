# Marvel-MVVM
A simple example with the Marvel API using MVVM architecture and Rx. You will find unit test of some classes (Repository, Interactor, Entity, ...) and some UITest.

## Installation
Before compile, yo should create a Marvel developer account and replace the strings `your public KEY` and `your private KEY` with your own keys. 
I have used `carthage` and you must execute `carthage update --platform ios` to compile the first time.
